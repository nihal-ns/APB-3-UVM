## Testbench Architecture

The testbench architecture follows a standard UVM structure, promoting modularity and reuse. It consists of an active agent for driving transactions, a passive agent for monitoring, and a scoreboard for checking data integrity.

### Key Components

* **`apb_agent`**: Encapsulates the driver, sequencer, and monitor. The environment uses both an active and a passive agent.
* **`apb_sequencer` & `apb_sequence`**: The sequencer controls the flow of `apb_seq_item` transactions, which are generated by various sequences to create interesting stimulus.
* **`apb_driver`**: Drives the sequence items onto the APB interface according to the bus protocol.
* **`apb_monitor`**: Passively monitors the APB interface and broadcasts observed transactions to the scoreboard.
* **`apb_scoreboard`**: Checks for functional correctness by comparing transactions captured by the active and passive monitors.
* **`apb_env`**: The top-level environment that instantiates and connects all the major verification components.
* **`apb_test`**: The base test class from which all specific tests are derived. It configures the environment and selects the primary sequence to run.

## Directory Structure

The project files are organized in a flat structure for simplicity.

## How to Run Simulation

A `Makefile` is provided to simplify the compilation and simulation process.

### Prerequisites

* A SystemVerilog simulator that supports UVM, such as **QuestaSim** or **Cadence Xcelium** etc.

### Commands

The following commands can be run from your terminal in the project's root directory.

1.  **Run the default simulation:**
    This compiles the design and runs the default test (`apb_test`) with normal verbosity.
    ```sh
    make
    ```

2.  **Run a specific test:**
    You can specify which test to run by setting the `test` variable.
    ```sh
    make test=<test_name>
    ```
    *Example:* `make h test=wr_test`

3.  **Change UVM Verbosity:**
    Use the shortcut targets for `HIGH` and `DEBUG` verbosity levels.
    * For high verbosity:
        ```sh
        make h
        ```
    * For debug verbosity (maximum output):
        ```sh
        make d
        ```

4.  **Clean up generated files:**
    This command removes the `work` directory, log files, and waveform files.
    ```sh
    make clean
    ```
